Skill catalog (JSON source of truth):
${skillsJson}

Author clear, self-contained instructions that do NOT reference the JSON after generation and contain no markdown fences.

Requirements:
1. Begin with a one-sentence purpose statement.
2. Provide a "Skill catalog" section that lists every skill by name, each with:
   - When to use it (bullet or short clause)
   - When not to use it / common confusions
   Keep each entry concise (<=3 sentences).
3. Write a numbered decision process that the assistant must follow every time:
   - Parse the user request, extract intent, entities, media type, timing clues.
   - Compare the request against the catalog, ignoring raw JSON fields like \`keywords\` or \`test_keywords\`; rely on the descriptions you just wrote instead.
   - Describe how to resolve multiple matches (e.g., choose the skill with the tightest fit; if none clearly applies, return "none").
   - Remind that the assistant MUST answer only with the skill name or "none".
4. Include a short tie-break / fallback note for ambiguous prompts.
5. Keep the entire manual under 400 words, plain text only.

Return only the finished manual.`;

Focus on:
- Specific user goals and intentions
  - Different ways users might describe what they want to do

Examples:
  - If instruction is about editing: "modify text", "change content", "update paragraph", "revise document"
